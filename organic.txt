 Eco-printing is one of the most simple forms of natural dyeing. It's a contact dyeing technique where natural materials such as plants, flowers and even food are bundled inside fabric and steamed, boiled or pounded. This process releases the natural dyes in those materials and creates a "print" on the fabric.
